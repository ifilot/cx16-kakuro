KAKURO
======

Introduction
------------
Kakuro is a logic-based number puzzle game, often described as a cross between a
crossword and Sudoku. In this game, players fill a grid with digits from 1 to 9,
with the objective of matching the sum of numbers in each row or column to a
given target. However, no number can be repeated within a single sum. Each clue
is represented as a small number in a black cell, dictating the sum of the
digits to be placed in the adjacent white cells.

Rules
----- 
* Kakuro is played on a grid of blank and black cells, where the goal is to fill
  in the blank cells with numbers. Some black cells have "clues" (a small number
  in the corner) indicating the sum of the numbers that must appear in the 
  consecutive blank cells in that row or column.
* Only the numbers 1 through 9 can be used to fill the blank cells.
* Within a "run" (a sequence of consecutive blank cells either in a row or a 
  column), the numbers cannot repeat. Each number within a run must be unique.
* The numbers in a run must add up to the sum indicated by the clue in the black
  cell.
* Each valid combination of numbers (in a run) must be used only once in the 
  entire puzzle. This means that no two different runs with the same number of 
  blank cells can have identical number combinations that sum to the same value.

Puzzles
-------
* The game contains (currently) 96 puzzles of various sizes and difficulty 
  levels. The size and difficulty are indicated by the number (6-10) in the
  menu screen and the number of stars, respectively.
* If a puzzle has been opened before, but not completed, it is colored in a
  light green color. Completed puzzles are colored in a dark green shade. The
  game will remember which puzzles have been completed before. You can always
  choose to play a completed game again.

Gameplay
--------
* Move your mouse cursor over the cell you want to fill and press a digit (1-9) on
  your keyboard to enter a number. 
* Once all the cells are correctly filled, the game will notify you 
  automatically. 
* If you'd like to validate your progress during the game, click the green/red 
  button at the top-right corner of the screen. 
* To exit the game, click the 'X' button or press the <ESCAPE> key.
