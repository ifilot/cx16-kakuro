KAKURO
------

Kakuro is a logic-based number puzzle game, often described as a cross between a
crossword and Sudoku. In this game, players fill a grid with digits from 1 to 9,
with the objective of matching the sum of numbers in each row or column to a
given target. However, no number can be repeated within a single sum. Each clue
is represented as a small number in a black cell, dictating the sum of the
digits to be placed in the adjacent white cells.

For the Commander X16, Kakuro offers a nostalgic experience, blending the
puzzle's classic challenge with the retro charm of 8-bit computing. Players
navigate the grid using the mouse and inputting numbers via keyboard. The game
tests mathematical reasoning and strategic thinking, making it an engaging
pastime for puzzle enthusiasts and retro gaming fans alike. The simplistic yet
captivating design ensures that Kakuro on the Commander X16 is both a mental
workout and a tribute to vintage gaming.
